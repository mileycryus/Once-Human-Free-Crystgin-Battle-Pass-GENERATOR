Once Human is a multiplayer open-world survival game that immerses players in a post-apocalyptic landscape shaped by the alien substance Stardust. 

The only way to obtain Crystgin is by purchasing it with real money through the in-game Top Up Center or authorized third-party platforms. This exclusivity underlines its value and the types of items it unlocks.  The pricing structure for Crystgin encourages bulk purchases, as larger packs offer a better rate per unit, making them more attractive for players intending to invest heavily in customization or premium content. During special promotions, such as the mobile launch event, discounts on Crystgin purchases can provide significant value, further incentivizing top-ups.

Once credited, Crystgin appears in the player’s account and can be spent immediately in the in-game store. This immediacy is crucial for players eager to access new cosmetics or event bundles as soon as they become available. For those seeking to maximize their experience or gain an edge in the early stages of a new scenario, topping up Crystgin provides a direct route to premium content without the grind.




Once Human Mobile is an ambitious open-world survival RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by alien corruption called Stardust. Developed by NetEase’s Exptional Global, it brings a blend of exploration, base-building, resource management, and combat to mobile platforms, offering a deep and challenging experience for both solo players and those who want to team up in multiplayer “Hive” groups. For complete beginners, the game’s systems can feel overwhelming, but understanding the core mechanics and following some essential strategies will set you on the path to survival and success.

The game begins with your character awakening as a Meta-Human, alone and vulnerable in a world transformed by the Stardust infection. Your first steps are guided by a tutorial, introducing you to movement, basic combat, and resource gathering. It’s crucial to pay attention during this phase, as the main questline is specifically designed to teach you the essentials-combat, crafting, resource collection, and base building. Once you’re free to explore, your primary goal is to establish a secure foothold in the world.

Choosing a Server and Scenario

Before you even create your character, you’ll need to select a server scenario. Scenarios define the world’s rules, available content, and overall difficulty. For beginners, the “Manibus” scenario is highly recommended. It offers a PvE-focused, balanced experience with manageable threats and a gentler learning curve, making it ideal for learning game mechanics without the pressure of PvP or harsh environmental hazards. More advanced scenarios, like “Way of Winter” or “Evolution’s Call,” introduce additional challenges such as extreme weather or player-versus-player combat and are best tackled after you’re comfortable with the basics.
